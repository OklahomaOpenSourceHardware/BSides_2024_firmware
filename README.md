# BSides_2024_firmware

Oklathon Edition!

This repo will contain firmware built during the Oklahton event. 

Each one should run on the 2024 edition of the badge, created for the BSides conference.

The badge includes RGB leds, and an IR transmitter, so ideas include:
* Mapping the led's to a matrix to display text
* Create a fun LED chase pattern
* Get the IR transmitter to turn a TV on and off
* Get the badges to communicate
* learn about Circuit Python
